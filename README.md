# Glass-Cleaning-Robot-Arm-Model
Model of a glass cleaning robot arm which simulates to glass cleaning actions. This project is combination of SolidWorks, MATLAB and Simulink.

### Selected Area Cleaning
We used forward and inverse kinematics blocks in Matlab to calculate the needed angles for the motor to rotate. We give the needed position as an x-y cordinate matrix and then Matlab takes some time to calculate the inverse kinematics. the calculated kinematics can be saved and can be directly give as input to the motors to rotate

### Rotaional Cleaning
We used two signal builders to give this rotational action
